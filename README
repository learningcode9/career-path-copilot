- **main branch** → collaboration branch, where JSON files for datasets, pipelines, and triggers are stored (source of truth).  
- **adf_publish branch** → automatically created by ADF when you click *Publish*. Contains ARM templates used for CI/CD deployment.

---

## 🚀 Current Pipelines

- **pl_copy_single_file**
  - Copies Job Description (JD) and Profile JSONs from `landing/` into `bronze/`.
  - Parameterized with `p_request_id` so JD + Profile run together for the same request.

---

## ⚡ Triggers

- **trig_landing_bronze**
  - Blob event trigger that starts the pipeline when a new `.json` file is added to `/landing/jd/`.

---

## 🏗️ Medallion Architecture

This project follows the Medallion data lake pattern:

- **Landing** → Raw uploads (JD & Profile JSONs).  
- **Bronze** → Ingested data, one-to-one copy from landing.  
- **Silver** → Cleaned & transformed data (to be built next).  
- **Curated (Gold)** → Final structured layer for analytics & UI.

---

## 🔗 CI/CD

- Use the **adf_publish** branch for deployments.
- `ARMTemplateForFactory.json` + `ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json` enable automated deployment with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Build Databricks notebooks to transform **Bronze → Silver**.
- Add `skills-matching` logic.
- Expose curated data for UI via Synapse / SQL Database.
